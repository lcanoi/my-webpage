## Overview
I was tasked to create a digital platform that allows Ternium employees to train in various areas of the industry through gamification (thus developing a video game beong essential). Moreover, this plataform had to be connected to a website where users could access the game to learn an specific topic, and where admins could administrate everything and get usefull information from data created by the game.
For this project I worked in a team of 5 Computer Science students.

## Tools
For the creation of this project, the tools that were mainly used were:
+ Unity: for the development of the Ternium game where employees can train and learn about the company
+ React.js: for the development of the web app
+ MySQL: for the database containing data for the web app and for the unity game
+ Python: for the API connecting the React web app to the SQL database

## Final Product:
Here you can see a video created by the team with the final simulation of the created web and game solutions, working together with the database and API. This video is in Spanish. Everything is explained further ahead in the post.

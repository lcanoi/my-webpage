I am Luis Cano, an Engineering student in Computer Science at the Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM). My main research interests include AI, Machine Learning, and data analytics. However, I am also knowledgeable of game/app development, web development, digital marketing, and multiple programming languages. I seek self-learning of these fields and am driven by looking forward to making innovative products with positive impacts in the world.

Currently work as a Digital Analyst, Web Developer, and SEO Analyst at [Forte Industria](https://forteindustria.com/) —an online retailer of industrial machinery— and at [Cocina del Chef](https://cocinadelchef.mx/) —an online retailer of kitchen-related products. Also have previous experience working at [Pixelwork](https://pixelwork.mx/) — designing and making multiple sites for other companies, working with SEO and mantaining multiple domains.

Moreover, I have worked in app development –working with Unity to develop UI/UX layouts as well as game features and mechanics, with react.js for creating web apps, and with AndroidStudio for developing apps for android devices. As well, I have succesfully completed multiple projects with work ranging from developing apps, APIs, neural networks, AI, web pages, databases, games, software, and project planning and design.
On these projects I have successfully worked in teams, communicating my ideas and leading the team where needed, while also valuing the different points of view of my teammates and learning from the insight of others.

Furthermore, I am experienced as well in teaching –having taught programming courses (of *Swift*) for younger students in two occasions.
